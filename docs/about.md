# 關於我們 About us

## 學生事務委員會

學生事務委員會主要由來自國內各大專院校的五至七名學生組成。我們共同擁有對語言學的熱情，並懷抱讓語言學知識在大學階段扎根的共同願景。因此，學生事務委員們每年定期舉辦《語言學沙龍》系列演講。在此期間，我們邀請專精於不同領域的國內教授擔任《語言學沙龍》的講者，分享他們精采的演講並交流研究方法與經驗。此外，我們也邀請具有語言學背景的學長姊分享語言學在生活層面的應用，以及與其他學問和技能的結合，形成全新的知識和技術。學生事務委員們衷心希望透過舉辦《語言學沙龍》和推廣語言學相關的活動和演講，能夠讓熱愛語言學的學子們與我們一同深入探索語言的奧秘。

The Student Affairs Committee is primarily composed of five to seven students from various domestic higher education institutions. We share a common passion for linguistics and harbor the collective vision of instilling linguistic knowledge at the university level. Consequently, the committee organizes an annual series of lectures called "Linguistics Salon."
During this event, we invite domestic professors specializing in different fields to serve as speakers for the Linguistics Salon. They bring captivating lectures and share their research methods and experiences. In addition, we extend invitations to alumni with a background in linguistics to share applications of linguistic principles in daily life and explore the integration of linguistics with other disciplines and skills, yielding innovative knowledge and techniques.
The committee earnestly hopes that, through organizing the Linguistics Salon and promoting linguistics-related activities and lectures, we can provide a platform for students passionate about linguistics to join us in delving into the mysteries of language.
